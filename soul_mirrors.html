							<p><i>“The most beautiful journeys are waiting outside your window.”</i></p>
							<p>
								Sure thing, Grandma, but are you even allowed to go on a journey during the pandemic?
								It’s been ages since I’ve eaten pho or met up with college friends. I was going to get
								an all-expense-paid trip to a conference in Seoul but that “journey” flew out the window
								when the whole world went on lockdown mode. But really, I shouldn’t be complaining. I’m
								actually not doing too badly. Didn’t lose my job or get sick. And I guess, these afternoon
								walks are sort of journey-like, though I don’t go on them for the fresh air. There isn’t much
								of that behind two masks. I go walking to interact with people’s soul mirrors, socially distanced of course.
							</p>
							<p>
								While fellow-walkers stuff their hands in sweatshirt pockets and quickly trudge past me
								without a second glance, their soul mirrors whip around them at glaring speed, trying to
								protect their owners from any threat to the delicate “new normal”. CDs, frisbee discs,
								turtle shells, and glass bubbles, they all try their hardest regardless of size. Yet there
								is only so much a soul mirror can deflect. When the pain is too great, they crack, maybe
								even chip away. Over time, soul mirrors become badges of honor, depicting all the difficulties
								their owners overcame. I search for those badges to understand their history and to admire the
								light peeking through the scars.
							</p>
							<p>
								A college student walks toward me now. She is in her own little world, wearing over-the-ear
								bluetooth headphones. Scrunched-up shoulders form a border around a military-green trench coat
								with a half-attached iron-on patch dangling from one sleeve. Her soul mirror is bouncing along
								next to her, a giant salad bowl, overflowing with rainbow silk scarves and bright flowers. The
								saturated colors disguise little bullet wounds scattered across the salad bowl. Where are those from?
							</p>
							<p><i>
								That time in 3rd grade when no one wanted to play with her, and she sat by herself in the playground
								during recess. A Saturday morning, when all the other girls made fun of her in dance class for mixing
								up “burgers” and “boogers”. They chased her out of the dance studio after she said that she liked eating
								boogers. In AP Chinese, when her high school crush told her that he liked someone else before she even
								gathered enough courage to confess. The rapid succession of rejections when she thought that she had what
								it took to get into an Ivy League School. She didn’t. Last semester, when she experienced her first Asian
								Fail in the form of a sinful A- on her transcript. Not being able to see her brother in Switzerland for
								over a year. Always putting too much on her plate and not knowing when to stop and say no to things.
								Constantly drowning and over-promising. Having no idea where to go next year with no more semesters at
								college to look forward to. Angry at everyone close to her for caring about her. Angry at the world for
								messing up everything. Angry at herself for being angry.
							</i></p>
							<p>
								My heart hurts and fumes with her. Even though the girl has never seen her soul mirror,
								the colorful bowl will stubbornly stay with her until the end, protecting her but also keeping
								all the hurt constantly within reach. Only those who are aware and willingly break their soul mirrors
								can be free from this blessing and burden.
							</p>
							<p>
								Good afternoon, I tell her. The student quickly looks up from the ground and glances in my direction.
								I stare into troubled milk-chocolate eyes. She can’t see my smile, so I raise my hand in greeting.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Hello</i>, she returns. I imagine a delicate smile hiding behind her black mask. With
								perfect Covid-19 etiquette, we pass each other on the sidewalk. I’m walking nearly on someone’s
								front yard, and the girl is stepping onto the road to maintain our distance. Her soul mirror glows
								silver briefly before it escapes my peripheral vision. I sense my own soul mirror wrap around me.
								A glowing green blanket that blocks out my vision and smells like cinnamon. After a few breaths,
								the warmth dissipates, and I’m by myself again. That’s when I miss my soul mirror the most.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s been gone for almost a decade now. The green bubble that you tried so hard to coax me
								out of years ago with delicious baked treats. I remember the sound of the wind flowing past my
								window as my parents drove me to your little cottage, so I could escape the noisy city. Mom told
								me that it was autumn because the trees were covered in blankets of sunrise, but I couldn’t see
								the golden and red leaves, just the shimmering walls of my soul mirror. After I arrived and heard
								the rumbling noises of dad’s Honda driving away, you caressed my hair and guided me to the kitchen
								for my first lesson.
							</p>
							<p>
								That’s when I finally met the fall season. The spicy and sugary scent of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.
								I heard the high-pitched creaking sound of an opening door, and a warm breeze passed through my protective orb.
								With your hand over mine, I brought a cold metal utensil to my mouth and took a bite of autumn. It was soft and moist.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>What do you feel?</i> You asked me.
							</p>
							<p>
								I widened my eyes in surprise. It had been a while since I got that question.
								Everyone else just asked about what I could or couldn’t see. I was curious about you
								and peered into the glimmering shapes in my soul mirror. I think I caught a glimpse
								of your smile, a thin patch of light a bit brighter than its surroundings. A dark shadow
								materialized in my vision, gently hovering in front of me. You said it was something
								called pumpkin bread, the best treat to eat when it started getting colder. I reached
								toward the sweet heat source for another bite.
							</p>
							<p>
								A few days later, you showed me a rectangular wild mushroom tart and then a circular
								german chocolate cake. When you took me outside to your precious herb garden, I saw
								little dashes in the rosemary shrub and floating buttons among the cherry tomato varieties.
								With you, the world was blurry in a happy and fluffy kind of way, like we were living
								inside a large white cotton ball.
							</p>
							<p>
								When you passed away, the cotton ball became a dark licorice jawbreaker. The shadows
								outside my soul mirror grew blacker and longer without your bright smile. I was a little kid
								trapped in bed scared of the monsters hiding in the closet. I could only bear it for a few
								days before my soul mirror fractured on the way to the city cemetery. A piece near my left
								eye chipped away, a clear little disk that fell onto my lap and quickly evaporated. I looked
								out the window of dad’s brand-new Honda Accord and finally saw the brilliance of autumn’s
								sunrise. It was beautiful and that made me angry. How could the world still be so beautiful
								without you next to me? How dare my soul mirror hide so much when I was at my happiest?
							</p>
							<p>
								I pounded my fists against the front of my soul mirror, enlarging the cracks beginning
								to spread across my little bubble. With a soft popping sound, my soul mirror shattered
								into tiny fragments. The pieces fluttered in the air for a second, reflecting the brilliant
								reds, yellows, and golds outside my window before they shimmered to mist and disappeared.
							</p>
							<p>
								A rush of colors and light flooded around me, replacing the space where my soul mirror
								used to be. I looked ahead to study my parents for the first time. My mom was staring
								sadly through her window, a black bun loosely tied to the back of her head. Her soul
								mirror sat in front of her like a makeshift airbag, a red dinner plate with one large
								crack zigzagging across the middle. A crack that recently got larger when you left us.
								My dad’s unruly yellow hair was slicked back, trying to match with the black tuxedo he
								was wearing. His soul mirror, a basket weaved from book pages, hovered protectively
								around my mom, trying to support the sagging dinner plate.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was strange to see my parent’s soul mirrors and their cracks. It made me wonder
								what cracks were on your soul mirror. I’m sad that I never got to see that part of you, 
								but I’m no longer hiding within a green bubble. My window is wide open to all kinds of
								journeys, fun or difficult.
